# Me-legna

  Hi, I'm a recent graduate from App Academy where I honed my skills in software development. My current expertise lies in JavaScript, Python, React/Redux, SQL and more. I have a passion for using technology to solve complex problems. During my time at App Academy, I worked on both solo and collaborative projects, allowing me to develop a strong understanding of the full-stack development process.

Aside from software development, I am an avid gamer and dabble in Dungeons & Dragons. I also enjoy cooking and experimenting with new recipes, as I believe it's important to have hobbies and interests outside of work.

I am always open to new opportunities and challenges, and I look forward to collaborating with others on impactful projects. If you have an interesting project in mind or just want to chat, feel free to reach out! Let's build something great together.
